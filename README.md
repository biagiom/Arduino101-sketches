# Arduino101-sketches
## Various sketches for Arduino/Genuino 101
* __AccessoryShield_BLE__: Use your Arduino/Genuino 101 to control the [DFRobot Accessory Shield](https://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1045) through BLE.
  This sketch use the CurieBle library and it also requires the [AccessoryShield library](https://github.com/biagiom/AccessoryShield)
* __BleRGB__: Use the CurieBLE library for Arduino/Genuino 101 to control a RGB led
* __Arduino101_EnvironmentalWebDataLogger__: Use your Arduino/Genuino 101 with the Ethernet Shield and 
  the DFRobot Accessory Shield as a powerful Web Environmental Monitor Data Logger
* __Arduino101_LedWebServer__: Use your Arduino/Genuino 101 to make a simple Web Server to control a led
* __Arduino101_SimpleWebServer__: Use your Arduino/Genuino 101 and the Arduino Ethernet Shield to make a simple Web Server
* __temperature_BLE__: Use your Arduino/Genuino 101 and the CurieBLE library to send measurements from the LM35 
  temperature sensor to other BLE devices
